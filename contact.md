# Support Manhole Project


**Donations:**<br>
We are attempting to make an independent VR animation film by collaborating as a small team of highly experienced animators, directors, researchers, and storytellers. For the past 8 months, we have been working together without any investment, except that of our effort and time.

>Why should you donate?
>1. The donation button here is for anyone to willingly contribute any amount ranging from 101 Rs. to 10,000 Rs. This is a way to encompass inclusive participation, from students to the working class, in sharing a concern to the cause and initiating a change.
>2. Through this contribution, you will also be supporting independent animation films in India, especially during the COVID-pandemic where all sorts of funding have been cut off leaving no source of livelihood for many. 
>3. We will also feature you as one of the partner contributors or as co-producers in the film credit by stating your contribution to this project.

For contributing please write to us and we shall share our account details. You can also contribute by lending or donating any high-end devices that shall help us complete the film. 

**Perhaps all that is needed is just a hand of 101 rupees to initiate a change that promises to lift a community out of Manhole.**
