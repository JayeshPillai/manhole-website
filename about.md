A manual scavenger’s experience inside a sewage manhole surpasses our understanding and imaginations. Our Humanity would tell us that it would be inhuman and unjust for any human to live through such a reality. Yet it is this very humanity that demands an urgency to make the experience of a manual scavenger an inclusive and integrated part of mainstream consciousness. Through a VR film, Manhole attempts to bridge this social gap by touching the experience of those who have, for generations, remained untouched.

## **Why VR Film?**

Experiencing the film in 360° virtual reality (VR) is to immerse oneself into the spatio-temporal reality of the characters in the story. You would find yourself standing next to the characters and experiencing the story unfold around you. This allows you to experience the world of Amitabh, Bunty and Billu as if you are one of the characters in the story, fully present in the story-environment. By facilitating a VR Film experience of a manual scavenger, ‘Manhole’ wishes to initiate a reconciliatory process in Indian society where compassion and empathy for the ones on the margins become a driver of social change.

This VR experience will have real-time 6 degree-of-freedom (6DOF) which allows the viewer to move around and explore the environment while experiencing the story. The film also explores the current state-of-the-art in audio experience. Our story environment would have 3D spatial audio. It provides an atmosphere where the sound responds to the direction of the viewer's point-of-view.
