# Introduction

> ... research involving an understanding of people’s interactions with various device **configurations** and **ecologies** is at the forefront of modern Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research

> However, this explosion of research topics has led to disconnected **terminology**, **techniques**, and **systems** creating a **fragmented** research landscape. In this paper, we unify this fragmented research under the umbrella of **cross-device computing**.

### Contributions of the paper:

1. A unified taxonomy and terminology for cross-device research
2. The mapping and reflective discussion of the current design space (across application domains, tracking systems, interaction techniques, and evaluation strategies)
3. The identification of opportunities and challenges informing a future research agenda of cross-device computing.
