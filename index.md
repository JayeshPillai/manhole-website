# THE EXPERIENCE

>“Compelled by the exigencies of poor economic life and caste identity, Amitabh, a young law graduate, becomes a manual scavenger. One day, to earn some extra money to support his family, he decides to get inside a large unsafe sewer to clear a blockage. He neither has protective gear, nor the accompanying engineer to check for poisonous gases. Will Amitabh come out safely?”

## Manhole - Short Film 
This short film was adjudged as one of the runners up in the [Unreal Shorts India Program 2021](https://technosports.co.in/2021/12/08/unreal-engine-shorts-india-program-celebrates-the-creativity-of-indian-storytellers-concludes-its-first-ever-shorts-challenge-in-india/){:target="_blank"}. The production of the film was supported by Epic Games, and it has been rendered out of Unreal Engine.
Currently the first phase of this initiative is completed, which is a cinematic short film.

What does it take to get inside a manhole without protective gear? How would it feel to submerge oneself inside a sewer blocked with human excreta? To explore these questions experientially, witness the journey of Amitabh in 'Manhole VR'.

**\*The team is currently seeking funding for the VR Film, which is the second phase of this initiative.**

# THE CONTEXT

> "In 2013, the [Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act](http://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A2013-25.pdf) criminalized the practice and employability of any form of manual cleaning, carrying, disposing or handling of human waste. Yet, about [62,904](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-manual-scavenging-problem/article30834545.ece){:target="_blank"} men and women are engaged in some form of manual scavenging."

  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/mvrimages/homepage_manholeenter2.png" alt="">
</figure>

**What is Manual Scavenging?**<br>
Manual scavenging is the occupation of sanitation work in India, involving manually cleaning and disposing of human excreta from public streets, insanitary dry latrines, septic tanks, gutters, sewers, or more often inside a street manhole.

<small>_* Number of deaths due to manual scavenging in India in 2019 is [110](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/110-deaths-by-cleaning-sewers-septic-tanks-in-2019/article30795201.ece){:target="_blank"}_</small>


**Why is it still continued as a practice in society?**<br>
Untouchability crept its way into Indian society, marginalizing lower caste-identities and eventually creating a depressed class crushed under the weight of inhuman practices, thus forcing the only community into such act.
