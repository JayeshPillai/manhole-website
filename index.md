I'm a second year Master's student in Interaction Design at the IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay.

My research interests are in the areas of Accessibility and HCI, Tangible Interfaces for Augmented Reality, and Creativity Support in VR environments. 

Before joining the IDC, I was an undergraduate student at IIT Bombay (2014 - 2018), where I majored in Civil Engineering with a minor degree in Design.
